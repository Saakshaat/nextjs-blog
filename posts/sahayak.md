This was a great attraction freshman year. Great for a quick 2 hour project right before my first flight to the US for university.

At this point, I was exploring Python as a data science tool and I wondered how well it would do for software engineering. This was also when I was fascinated by chatbots and voice assistants. So through this project I married these two interests.

By the way, **Sahayak** translates to assistant in [Hindi](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN838IN838&sxsrf=ALeKk03PZXu5wiAYb7wYEJYKbH3b_isK4g%3A1594450515698&ei=U2IJX4SRKtiS0PEPqNia8Ak&q=sahayak+to+english&oq=sahayak+to+english&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjoECAAQR1DCPljCPmCSQ2gAcAF4AIABYogBYpIBATGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjEhuaEz8TqAhVYCTQIHSisBp4Q4dUDCAw&uact=5).

- The application recorded the user's voice inputs and converted it to text using a speech recognition library. It, then, looked for actionable verbs in the command and performed a related operation, speaking the end result by converting it through **Google's TTS**.

- It could look up information on your web browser using **Selenium**, play videos on YouTube, start applications on your system.

- It could perform complex calculations using **Wolfram Alpha's API**.
