In the wake of COVID-19, as the world scrambled to find solutions for more demanding problems, my team started focusing on a tangent that would directly address the most important problem: Quarantine.

Quarantine became difficult to survive because people started feeling disconnected. So we came up with an idea to bring people together through online events.

Dequarantine was a central hub any and all online events happening around the world.

US, UK, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, India.
I was managing over 7 developers from all these countries in an agile environment.

- Our product was a simple application tying users to events. 
  
- As tech lead, I was handling all 3 teams for **backend**, **frontend** and **mobile development**, while working on the backend myself.

- This was my first time as tech lead and the challenges I faced, managing so many people, each in a different timezone, gave me a good perspective on how product development works in tech.
